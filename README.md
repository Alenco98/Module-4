# Module-4

Purpose:

A simple quiz made using JS, CSS, and HTML which assesses your skills in Javascript. 

Questions were sourced primarily from the W3 website's Javascript section, mostly based on the first few lessons from it.

Honestly its not that good, for some reason I couldn't figure out how to save the high scores, but at least the questions go through. Overall i'd rate it 7/10
